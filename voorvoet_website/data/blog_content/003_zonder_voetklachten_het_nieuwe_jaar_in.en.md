The fresh start of the new year often brings the urge to make positive changes, and for many this means setting good resolutions. Perhaps sports, more exercise or simply enjoying a relaxing walk are high on your list. And it's so much better if that's possible without foot complaints!

The definition of 'comfortable walking' differs from person to person. Some experience pure walking pleasure when they have 10 km or more on the clock or can go into the mountains, while others are very satisfied with the ability to do their own shopping independently or take a short walk for some fresh air.

The importance of walking without foot complaints is invaluable, but unfortunately many people experience problems with 'comfortable walking' or movement in general. This can be due to recurring injuries, previous falls or simply because the 'undercarriage' is not functioning properly. Such problems can manifest in various complaints, including foot or ankle complaints, knee complaints, hip complaints, or (lower) back complaints. But also ingrown toenails, excessive callus formation and recurring corns can cause a lot of pain complaints.

Whatever your ambitions are, or whatever definition you attach to comfortable walking, I'm here to help when you encounter obstacles. With more than 15 years of experience as a podiatrist, I am dedicated to helping people with various foot complaints, or complaints of the knees, hips or back. Since last year, I have been working with great pleasure in my own podiatry practice.

My approach starts with carefully listening to your story and complaints, with the aim of identifying the cause and finding effective solutions. Can the complaint be completely or partially resolved with therapy or aids? Or is advice sufficient? What steps can you take yourself? What should you look for when choosing new footwear? Are there specific exercises you can do at home? Sometimes small and temporary adjustments are sufficient, think of taping or pressure relief by applying felt. But also long-term aids such as podiatric insoles (known as orthotic insoles), an orthosis (silicone toe piece) or a brace to prevent ingrown toenails can be a solution.

I derive satisfaction from the fact that even small adjustments can have a great effect, allowing you to walk as comfortably and pain-free as possible, regardless of your ambitions. If necessary, I work together with other professionals, such as physiotherapists, exercise therapists, pedicurists or practice nurses from general practitioners, because collaboration leads to optimal results. So, let's take steps together towards a year without foot complaints.
