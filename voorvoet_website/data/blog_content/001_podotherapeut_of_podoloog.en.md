# The difference between a podiatrist and a podologist?
It can happen to anyone: suddenly you have sore feet. Sometimes so severe that you can barely stand or walk on them. We quickly start looking for a solution and turn to Google. But what do you type in? Podologist Enschede or Podiatrist Enschede? The terms podiatrist and podologist are often used interchangeably. What is the difference? Although both professions focus on complaints of the lower extremity (read: lower back and below), there is definitely a difference between these professional groups.

Podiatry is a profession that is legally recognized and protected by the [BIG Act, article 34](https://www.bigregister.nl/registratie/nederlands-diploma-registreren/wet--en-regelgeving). A podiatrist is required to have successfully completed a four-year HBO Podiatry degree ("Bachelor's Degree"). This comprehensive education provides in-depth knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and pathology of the foot, as well as research and treatment skills in the field of podiatry. After obtaining this HBO bachelor's degree, a podiatrist is officially recognized as a paramedic. Usually, a podiatrist is registered with the Dutch Association of Podiatrists and included in the independent Quality Register for Paramedics. The title "podiatrist" is legally protected.

The title 'podologist', on the other hand, is not legally protected and can be used by anyone. The education level for podologists can vary from a solid education to a shorter course. The bottom line is that anyone can call themselves a podologist, including those who sell ready-made insoles. Incidentally, the professional titles podokinesiologist, podopostural therapist and podo-orthesiologist are also not protected.

Both podiatrists and podologists focus on complaints of the lower extremity. But where a podologist is mainly focused on fitting insoles, a podiatrist also treats nail and toe problems, can apply temporary therapy, and provides basic wound treatment for diabetics and rheumatism patients. In the field of foot care, the podiatrist is the only professional practitioner with an HBO education who is legally recognized by the Ministry of Education.
