# The basics: what are orthotic insoles or podiatric insoles?
Podiatric insoles, also called orthotic insoles, insoles or inlays, are specially designed to correct or support the position and movement of the feet. They are custom-made by podiatrists, paramedical specialists who specialize in examining and treating foot problems. Orthotic insoles are nowadays often digitally measured and designed for the individual needs of the patient.

# Why podiatric insoles?
1. Supporting or correcting foot position: One of the main benefits of orthotic insoles is correcting abnormalities in foot position. These abnormalities can lead to numerous painful conditions such as forefoot complaints, heel spurs or problems in the knee, hip or back. The insoles provide support and correction, allowing you to correct foot position or distribute excessive pressure under your feet more evenly.
2. Pain relief: People with foot problems often experience pain while walking or standing for long periods. Podiatric insoles reduce pressure under certain points of the foot, thereby relieving pain. This makes it possible to move through daily life more comfortably and with less discomfort.
3. Prevention of injuries: Insoles can also serve as a preventive measure against injuries. By providing the right support for an abnormal position, they reduce the risk of overload and the development of new foot-related problems.
4. Improvement of posture and balance: The influence of orthotic insoles is not limited to the feet alone. They can also have a positive effect on overall body posture and balance. After all, good balance starts with a solid foundation, and that starts with your feet.

# Custom work
Podiatric insoles are custom-made, taking into account the unique characteristics and wishes of each patient. The podiatrist performs a comprehensive examination, analyzing aspects such as gait pattern, pressure points and any foot problems or problems in the knee, hip or back. Based on this data, the podiatrist can design insoles that perfectly match the individual needs of the patient. Where one person benefits from total support, another may need a small correction.

# The importance of expert advice
If you experience foot complaints, it is wise to consult a podiatrist. Although insoles are available at drugstores and shoe stores, they do not offer custom-made solutions for specific foot problems or complaints of the knee, hip or back. A professional assessment and possible adjustment are important for achieving optimal results. In addition to fitting insoles, the podiatrist can also provide you with the right advice regarding the complaints. Think of advice about load, footwear and possible exercises. Where necessary, we work together with other healthcare professionals such as pedicurists, physiotherapists and practice nurses from the general practice. There is also good cooperation with various specialized shoe stores in the area. Expert advice on the right shoes can be found at [Tiptoo](https://www.tiptoo.nl/), [Nijhuis schoenen](https://nijhuisschoenen.nl/) and especially for the little ones at [Flip schoenmode](https://www.flip-schoenen.nl/).
